# CapstoneProject

Below lists three Ideas for my Capstone Project 

1. Google review VS Yelp review 

Issue: Google and Yelp give different ratings for the same business. I often have a hard time to decide if I want to visit a restaurants or a hair salon because of the different ratings. 

Questions: 
Is the rating difference systematic, i.e. one is always higher than the other one? 

What is causing the rating difference? 

Which one should I trust more?

Potential data for analysis: 
Extract restaurant data for a specific area - a neighborhood in Boston; select a certain number of restaurants (50 or 100) for each ethnicity group, such as Chinese, Italian, Indian, etc. 
Chart the rating differences of each restaurant from the two courses - are they different? 
If they are vary different, could look into the difference in ethnicity, gender, etc. for each restaurant. See if there are differences. 

2. Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma social media study 

Issue: two damaging hurricanes hit the United States within a short timespan. How do people respond to these natural diasters on social media, such as twitter? 

Question: 
What are people talking about? 

When did people start talking about these hurricanes? 

What posts are shared most? 

Are there difference in people's response to Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma? 


Potential data for analysis: 
Download data that contains "Harvey" and "Irma" from twitter, from 1 month before each event to today. 
Identify the most mentioned words in the posts, and chart the frequencies of the "Harvey' and "Irma" of each day. 


3. Impact of historical earthquakes

Issue: are we doing better and better in reducing damages and fatalities in large earthquakes? 
Chart earthquakes with magnitude > 7
Number of fatalities and the total loss of properties in each earthquakes; location of these earthquakes; the GDP of the countries
