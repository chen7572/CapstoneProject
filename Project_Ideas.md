# CapstoneProject
Below lists three Ideas for my Capstone Project

What is causing the rating difference? 
Which one should I trust more? 
Potential data for analysis: 
Extract restaurant data for a specific area - a neighborhood in Boston; select a certain number of restaurants (50 or 100) for each ethnicity group, such as Chinese, Italian, Indian, etc. 
Find the high
