## Capstone Project

Here lists three ideas for my Capstone Project 

#### 1. Google review *VS* Yelp reviews 

Issue: Google and Yelp give different ratings for the same business. I often have a hard time to decide if I want to visit a restaurant or a hair salon because of the different ratings. 

Questions: 
+ Is the rating difference systematic, i.e. one is always higher than the other one? 
+ What might be causing the rating differences? 
+ Which one should I trust more?

Potential data for analysis: 
+ Extract restaurant data for a specific area, such as a neighborhood in Boston; select a certain number of restaurants (50 - 100) for each ethnicity group, such as Chinese, Italian, Indian, etc. 
+ Chart the rating differences of each business from the two sources - are they different? 
+ If they are vary different, could look into the difference in ethnicity, gender, etc. for each restaurant. 


#### 2. Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma social media study 

Issue: two damaging hurricanes have hit the United States within a short timespan. How do people respond to these natural diasters on social media, such as twitter? 

Questions: 
+ What are people talking about? 
+ When did people start talking about these hurricanes? 
+ What posts are shared most? 
+ Are there difference in people's response to Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma? 

Potential data for analysis: 
+ Download data that contains "Harvey" and "Irma" from twitter, from a week before each event to today. 
+ Identify the most mentioned words in the posts, and chart the frequencies of the "Harvey' and "Irma" of each day. 

Update: it appears that users can only download tweets during the past 7 days for free. So downloading the historical data seems like a challenge. An online twitter dataset for Hurrican Harvey is available:  https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc993940/

And can use this dataset as a start. 


#### 3. Impact of historical earthquakes

Issue: are we doing better in reducing damages and fatalities in large earthquakes? 

Questions: 
+ Is the total loss at large earthquakes decreasing over the years? 
+ Which countries are doing better at reducing the damages? And what have they done to achieve this? 

Potential data for analysis: 
+ Chart the locations of earthquakes with magnitude > 7 in the past 30 years;
+ Get the number of fatalities and the total loss of properties in each earthquake, the GDP of the countries where each earthquake happened
